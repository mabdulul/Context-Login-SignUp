This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Salon-Assist 

The goal of this project was to create an application that would allow customers of a salon to complete a questionnaire. Once they complete it, Stylist would have information about their clients. This application allows customers to create a login, complete a questionnaire, make appointments, and add comments to future appointments. The customers would also be able to edit the questionnaire and view future and past appointments.





### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

This is a full-stack application. I am using React, Express, and Postgres. Clients of a salon can sign up and complete a questionnaire about their hair and make an appointment. You can see a demo
